<h3>Modern computer performance is often represented in instructions per cycle (IPC) which measures the architecture's efficiency at any frequency of the clock; a faster IPC rate means the computer is quicker. Older computers had IPC counts that were as low as 0.1 while modern processors reached near 1. Superscalar processors can execute multiple instructions per clock cycle to achieve three to five IPCs.
This would be inaccurate to count machine-language instructions, since they can do various quantities of work in different ISAs.
 The "instruction" in the standard measurements is not a count of the ISA's machine-language instructions, but a unit of measurement, usually based on the speed of the VAX computer architecture. Many people used to calculate the speed by clock (usually in MHz or GHz) of a device. That refers to the CPU 's key clock cycles per second. This metric, however, is somewhat deceptive, because a system with a higher clock rate can not automatically perform better. As a result , manufacturers have stepped away from clock speed as a output metric.Other factors affect speed, such as mixing functional units, bus speeds, memory available and the type and order of instructions in the programs.
There are two main speed types: latency and the output. 
Latency is the time between the beginning and completion of a process. Throughput is the amount of time per unit job performed. Interrupt latency is the system's maximum guaranteed response time to an electronic event (such as when the disk drive terminates moving some data).Performance is affected by a very wide range of design choices â€” for example, pipelining a processor usually makes latency worse, but makes throughput better. Computers that control machinery usually need low interrupt latencies. These computers operate in a real-time environment and fail if an operation is not completed in a specified amount of time. For example, computer-controlled anti-lock brakes must begin braking within a predictable and limited time period after the brake pedal is sensed or else failure of the brake will occur.Benchmarking takes all these factors into account by measuring the time a computer takes to run through a series of test programs. Although benchmarking shows strengths, it shouldn't be how you choose a computer. Often the measured machines split on different measures. For example, one system might handle scientific applications quickly, while another might render video games more smoothly. Furthermore, designers may target and add special features to their products, through hardware or software, that permit a specific benchmark to execute quickly but don't offer similar advantages to general tasks. </h3>
