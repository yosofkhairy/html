<h2>Definition of computer architecture</h2>

<h3>The computer architecture is concerned with balancing a computer system's performance, capacity, expense, and reliability. The architecture of the instruction set can be used to demonstrate the balance of certain conflicting factors. More complex instruction sets allow programmers to write more space-efficient programs as some higher-level abstraction can be encoded by a single instruction. 
Complex instructions take the processor longer to decipher and can be more difficult to execute effectively. A large instruction set's increased complexity often provides more space for unreliability when instructions communicate in unexpected ways.
Implementation includes integrated circuit design, packaging, control, and refrigeration. Project optimisation includes experience with compilers, logic design operating systems, and packaging.</h3>
