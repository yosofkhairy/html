<h3>The term "architecture" in machine literature can be traced back to the 1959 work of Lyle R. Johnson and Frederick P. Brooks, Jr., members of the department of Machine Organization at IBM 's main research centre. Johnson had the opportunity to write a proprietary research correspondence about the Range, a Los Alamos National Laboratory (at that time known as Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory) supercomputer developed by IBM. In order to explain the degree of detail to be used to address the luxuriously embellished computer, he noted that his definition of formats, instruction styles, hardware parameters and speed improvements was at the degree of "system architecture," a concept that seemed more useful than that “machine organization”.
The earliest computer architectures were developed on paper and then incorporated directly into the final hardware shape. Later, prototypes of computer architecture were physically designed in the form of a transistor-transistor logic (TTL) computer, such as the 6800 prototypes and the PA-RISC, checked and modified before committing to the final hardware model. As of the 1990s , new computer architectures are usually "designed," tested, and tweaked — within some other computer architecture in a computer architecture simulator; or as a soft microprocessor within an FPGA; or both — before committing to the final hardware type.</h3>
